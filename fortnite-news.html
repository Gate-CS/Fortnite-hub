            <h2> CHAPTTER 6 SEASON 1 HUNTERS!! </h2>

            <img src="">
            <p>There 2 bosses that each drop an ONI Mask.</p>
            <p>One boss travels across the map and drops the Fire Oni mask. It deals a hundred damage and it can lock on people. It has infinite charges if you get the mythic version. You can get a fire mask from a chest but it only has fifeteen charges. The boss is very powerful and i suggest not fighting it alone.</p>

            <p>The other boss spawns on the spawn island and it drops the Void mask and the mythic Typhoon Blade. The void mask lets you teleport by clicking the aim button. You can also get the Void mask from chests but it also has fifeteen charges.</p>

            <p>>There are also new weapons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Typhoon Blade: The Typhoon Blade has finite life but it is very good movement. The spawn island boss drops the mythic version which has more life. The Typhoon Blade also does decent damage at close range.

                </li>
                <li>HOLO Twister Assault Rifle: This Assault Rifle is very good. It does good damage at long range and medium. It doesnt have the best fire rate but it is the AR that you should be using.
